          with fellow volunteers over ServeUsâ€™ social network, and share posts across other social media. ServeUs is supported by the \

        want to use any of the conventional platforms, I built her a site with a CMS (Content management system) so that she can add, remove and update her content without asking me. \
        I built this site after working as a fullstack developer at AltSource for 4 month with a software developer title. The frontend is using VueJS combo\'d with \
        Vuetify to speed up website creation. The API was built using ASP.NET and a ORM to manage the database. Several optimizations were added to handle images, \
        something I have had no prior experience with.',

      description:
        'The Pacific University OS class taught by \
        <a href="http://zeus.cs.pacificu.edu/chadd/>Professor Chadd Williams</a> required students to make a non-visual \
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway\'s Game of Life</a>. \
        A stipulations of the assignment is that each cell would only be one byte; this is due to the calculation that a 100,000 by 100,000 game was necessary; \
        this made optimization without using only the amount of memory the grid consisted of in total difficult. \
        Other requirements were that our end product had to use a number of threads specified by the user and it was to be written in C. \
        Through the use of bit manipulation, I managed to make my version of the Game of Life fast. \
        By the end of the project I know that there was more optimization that could have been done, like loop unraveling and removing the needs for bounds checking.\
         After adding threads I wasnâ€™t completely satisfied with a console output for generations birth\'s and death\'s totals, so I went about exporting every generation \
         to a PNG format using ligpng and then compiling those images to GIFs. An Imgur album is linked below and you can see an example above. Using the remaining memory \
         I had left over I managed to add colors to the dead cells for a number of things. When cells die they leave a stain on that particular cell that may be permanent \
         depending on the console commands, random colors (this did not turn out well), and a two-color fade where dead cells fade from one color to another before disappearing.',
